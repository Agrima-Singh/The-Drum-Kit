# The-Drum-Kit
An interactive drum kit web app built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project is designed to simulate a real drum set experience directly in the browser, allowing users to play different drum sounds via keyboard input or mouse clicks. It’s a fun and beginner-friendly project focused on DOM manipulation, event handling, and audio integration in front-end development.


Features:
1. Keyboard & Click Support – Play drum sounds by pressing specific keys or clicking on-screen buttons.
2. Audio Feedback – Each key or button triggers a corresponding drum sound.
3. Visual Animation – Brief animations indicate active key presses for better user feedback.
4. Lightweight & Fast – No dependencies or frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
